Lightbikes3D
============

Yet another TRON lightbikes 3D game implementation.

Currently heavily under development, but `master` should be stable.

To try it out, clone and `make run`.

Controls
--------

- Control the bike with the `left` and `right` arrow keys.
- When you die, you can change the bike you look at with the arrow keys.
- `Enter` or `Space` starts a new game.
- `Escape` or `Q` exits the game.

Some sort of multiplayer is planned, probably even client-server.

I would be happy to get some information about existing bots.

Have fun!
