Lightcycles3D
=============

Yet another TRON lightcycles 3D game implementation.

Currently heavily under development, but `master` should be stable.

To try it out, clone and `make run`.

Controls
--------

- Control your lightcycle with `A` and `D` (Player 1) or the `left` and `right` arrow keys (Player 2).
- When you die, you can change the lightcycle you look at with `A` and `D` or `left` and `right`.
- `Enter` or `Space` starts a new game.
- `Escape` or `Q` exits the game.

Client-server multiplayer is planned.

I would be happy to get some information about existing bots.

Have fun!
